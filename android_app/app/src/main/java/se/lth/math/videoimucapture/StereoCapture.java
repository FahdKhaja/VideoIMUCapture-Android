    // ------------------------------------------------------- periodic pairs inside a video

    // ReconStab #36: a two-lens pair dropped into the walk video at a fixed interval, so the
    // solve carries the factory 18.019 mm ruler every metre of walk instead of only at the
    // OBJECT stations the operator stops for.
    //
    // HOW, AND WHY NOT A ONE-SHOT REQUEST. The obvious build fires a TEMPLATE_VIDEO_SNAPSHOT
    // at both physical streams once a second. Two things are wrong with it on this device.
    // First, the idle sensor has to be warmed up before it will answer (see captureStereoPair
    // below: ERROR_CAMERA_BUFFER on the cold stream), and at 1 Hz with a 900 ms warm-up the
    // second sensor is running the whole time anyway. Second, a one-shot request inserted into
    // the repeating stream either steals a sensor frame from the video -- a 33 ms hole every
    // second -- or has to reproduce the recording request exactly, and any key it gets wrong
    // (zoom, exposure, the AE range the blur budget is driving) lands in one video frame.
    //
    // So instead: while periodic pairs are on, Camera2Proxy adds both physical streams to the
    // REPEATING request for the whole recording. Every sensor frame then arrives here from both
    // lenses, is acquired and released -- the drain that already exists for the warm-up -- and
    // once per interval the next frame on each lens is KEPT. No extra request, no frame stolen,
    // and the two kept frames are the same sensor period as one of the video's own frames. The
    // pair is simultaneous because it is one request's output, not because two shutters were
    // asked nicely to coincide.
    //
    // The unmeasured cost, which the S1/S2 test cells exist to measure: both sensors run for
    // the whole clip (power, heat, and whatever the HAL does to the logical stream when its
    // physical outputs are requested alongside it).
    //
    // MATCHING. Images lead results by a few frames on this hardware (measured for RAW; see
    // drainRawPairs). Arming "the next image" would therefore keep whichever frame happened to
    // be in flight, and if the two readers were a frame apart the kept pair would be too. So
    // the arm is a TARGET TIMESTAMP a few frames in the future, and each lens keeps its first
    // frame at or after it. The metadata row is matched to the repeating result whose stamp is

     *
     * CORRECTED 2026-08-02, and the earlier version of this method was the bug it claimed to
     * fix. It pinned CONTROL_ZOOM_RATIO to 1.0f and called that "no zoom". On a logical
     * multi-camera 1.0 is not neutral — it is main-camera framing BY DEFINITION, because the
     * ratio is expressed relative to the logical camera's default field of view. Ratios below
     * 1.0 are what widen it onto the ultrawide. This device's own numbers say so exactly:
     * factory fx is 1651.15 (ultrawide) against 2755.65 (main), and 1651.15/2755.65 = 0.599.
     * So 0.6 IS the ultrawide's native field of view, and 1.0 asks the HAL to crop it away.
     * The operator found this from the other end, by setting the app's zoom_ratio preference
     * to 0.6 and watching the full sensor appear.
     *
     * Worse, the old code read CONTROL_ZOOM_RATIO_RANGE, confirmed its lower bound could go
     * below 1.0, and then pinned 1.0 anyway — and from API 30 the zoom ratio governs, so it
     * overrode the per-physical crop regions set immediately below it.
     *
     * MEASURED CONSEQUENCE: all 40 stereo pairs in data/capture_raw/s24u_20260801 that
     * recorded a zoom ratio recorded 1.0, and none recorded 0.6. Every stereo pair ever shot
     * with this app is main-framed — the ultrawide's entire reason for being in the pair was
     * discarded at capture time, on every single one.
     *
     * Note the user's zoom_ratio preference does NOT reach here: copyBase() does not carry
     * CONTROL_ZOOM_RATIO, so the preference governs preview and video while the stereo still
     * took whatever this method set. Setting the preference alone would have produced pairs
     * that looked corrected on screen and were not.

     * full array. At 0.6 the same stream measures 1.658x wider than the main camera against a
     * census prediction of 1.636, and the main camera's own stream is unchanged (1.000). The
     * zoom has to be in the REPEATING request the pair is warmed on, not only in the one-shot:
     * a one-shot at 0.6 dropped into a stream at 1.0 came back reporting 1.0 in five of six
     * bursts, because the HAL will not switch master lens for a single frame.
