/**
 * OBJECT mode's one press: a focus stack across the subject's depth, an exposure bracket, a
 * full-quality RAW, and the stereo pair that makes the capture metric -- in sequence, in a
 * session of its own.
 *
 * A 15-second SEQUENCE of posted stages, not an instant, and the button that fires it had no
 * guard. Two presses started two composites: two directories, two writers racing for the same
 * file, two sets of stage handlers reconfiguring focus and exposure under each other, and a
 * lockAutoAlgorithms(false) from the first landing in the middle of the second. The button
 * gives no hint that it is busy, so this was one impatient tap away at all times. Hence
 * {@link #isActive()}.
